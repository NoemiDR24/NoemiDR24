## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am not currently working on any projects, but I am learning more about using GitHub. I am excited to begin my training with Tech Elevator, collaborate on projects with my classmates, and receive the help I need from my instructors to successfully complete my course.

Let me tell you a little about myself. I am currently married and have three young daughters that I enjoy spending time with, watching movies, and going on outings. My favorite colors are black and blue. I also enjoy doing puzzles, knitting, and sewing clothes for my family.
